I created YAMT because I wanted to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and static
site generators (specifically Hugo). This theme can be used as a starting point
to  build a more complex/fully featured one if so desired.

- ## Scope
  As a starting point `hugo new theme yamt` was used. I then added my own stuff
  step by step. The scope of this theme is to be minimalistic and lightweight.
  There is no JavaScript included. It is somewhat responsive, meaning it is
  decent to look at with narrow screens (like smartphones) as well as your
  regular PC monitor. Dark and light modes are included via media queries. So no
  sudden flashbangs if your browser/OS uses a dark theme.
  
- ## Features
  YAMT's includes the following features:
  - Responsive design
  - Light and dark theme variants
  - Support for i18n and multiple languages
  - Shortcodes and layouts
  - Math support (\(\KaTeX\))
  - Taxonomie system
  - Blog
  - RSS

I tested this theme on a few recent web browsers (Webkit-based, Chromium-based,
Ladybird and Firefox). Even older/simpler ones like Netsurf work without horrible artefacts.

- ## Documentation
  I'll try to document everything inside the `example`-directory which is then
  rendered on this website.

- ## Contribution
  If you feel the need to improve something or would like to add a feature
  that is in the scope of this theme, open up an issue or send a pull request.
